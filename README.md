# Bank-Management
Customer management
## Classes
1. Customer 
2. Banker

## Functionality 
Two classes are created because the banker has more priorities than the customer. Customers can check their balance, withdraw a certain amount of money and transfer some money to another account. However, the banker can do all of the above plus he can and he actually has to open a new account, withdraw, deposit and access personal information about the customer. Therefore, class Banker inherits from class Customer. Class Banker has all the features that the Customer class does plus it adds its own features.
